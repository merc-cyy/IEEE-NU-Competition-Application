## Background
My team and I won the annual Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers invite-only competition held in Northwestern, Chicago.

Many students found it hard to find places to volunteer around Evanston, our local town, and especially places that matched their interests.
So my team and I built NUVolunteers.org, an application that uses ML models to match students to volunteer opportunities that match their user profile and interests.

This is the frontend service of the system.
